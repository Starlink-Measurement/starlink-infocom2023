name: 'Network Characteristics of LEO Satellite Constellations: A Starlink-Based Measurement
  from End Users'
description: Low Earth orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) have been advocated as a key
  infrastructure for truly global coverage in the forthcoming 6G. This paper presents
  our initial measurement results and observations on the end-to-end network characteristics
  of Starlink, arguably the largest LSN constellation to date. Our findings confirm
  that LSNs are a promising solution towards ubiquitous Internet coverage over the
  Earth; yet, we also find that the users of Starlink experience much more dynamics
  in throughput and latency than terrestrial network users, and even frequent outages.
  Its user experiences are heavily affected by environmental factors such as terrain,
  solar storms, rain, clouds, and temperature, so is the power consumption. We further
  analyze Starlink's current bent-pipe relay strategy and its limits, particularly
  for cross-ocean routes. We have also explored its mobility and portability potentials,
  and extended our experiments from urban cities to wild remote areas that are facing
  distinct practical and cultural challenges.
